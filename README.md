# CST8284-Assignment-1
Please refer to README.md file for project description.

This is my first assignment for my Object-Oriented Programming class. In this project, we used 
object-oriented principles to input a user's fitness level:
-Steps walked
-Distance walked
-Calories burnt
-Maintenance calories

The program uses values inputted by the user to calculate distance walked in meters based on gender, 
as well as maintenance calorie calculations based on calorie intake and activity level.
